                            Eduardo Cervantes is a point and shoot photographer
                            and all around wanker.<br />
                            Eduardo Cervantes has the ability to show the world
                            in a way that simultaneously irrational and
                            logical.<br />
                            His eyes are so powerful he can see through time,
                            forwards, backwards and sideways. His images will
                            make you double over with thought–unless your head
                            explodes first.<br />
                            He normally doesn’t talk about himself in third
                            person and really tries to not take himself too
                            seriously.

                            I will update this in the near future, which usually
                            means never.
